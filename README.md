# Credit Card Transactions Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of credit card transactions to explore and visualize the distribution of various numerical features. The main focus is on understanding the data and preparing it for further modeling or anomaly detection.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transaction records with multiple numerical features along with a target column `Class` which indicates fraudulent transactions.

---

## Key Features

- Data exploration using histograms for numerical variables
- Use of KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) to visualize distribution shapes
- Clean and readable plots with adjusted layouts and color coding

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running `.ipynb` files)

Install required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

    1. Load the dataset in a Python environment or Jupyter notebook.

    2. Run the provided code to generate histograms of all numerical features excluding the target.

    3. Visualize the distribution patterns and identify any anomalies or interesting patterns.
